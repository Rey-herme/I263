First : Beam tuning on mass 219 -> When optimising the beam, give the yeld to the operators of the accelerator
Once beam is optimised, rotate target
Take the best of the 2 targets for implantation of long lived isotopes
vent switchyard + cool down target -> Target change
Test both targets
Take the best for decay spectro

rp093233 -> Z=93 A=233
